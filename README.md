# numbers-list-and-weather-forecast

Part of initial recruitment test by STAMPS, I was tasked to create two programs which covers these topics:

##  1. Mini Program: Numbers Array

Criteria: 
1. shows number from 1 to 100 in reversed.
2. not show prime numbers.
3. change number that's divisible by 3 with text "Foo"
4. change number that's divisible by 5 with text "Bar"
5. change number that's divisible by 3 & 5 with text "FooBar"
6. numbers are lined side by side 

Result :

## 2. Jakarta Weather Forecast 

Criteria: 
1. uses external API from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org)
2. shows weather forecast in **Jakarta** for the **next 5 days**
3. only shows **1 temperature for each day**

Result :

### Personal Take

Thanks to this experience, I was able to further enrich my knowledge as I was able to get reminded on how to use "for loop" in Typescript while trying to finish the two tasks, and also to get to know more syntaxes for mathematic operations in coding (such as %).
